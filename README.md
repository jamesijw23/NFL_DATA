# NFL Data Analysis

What makes a NFL team good (winning season or appearance in playoff)?
Two other questions that relate to the main question are:
  * What do the Patriots do be so good?
  * What do the Browns do be so bad?
  
The following data set has the play by play of every NFL game from 2009 to 2015. There are many directions that be taken to answer these 
questions, however, I will focus on three areas one can assume has to determine if a team to be good or bad: 
  * The offense gets alot of Yards, while defense prohibits yards (passing/rushing)
  * Offense does not produce turn overs, defense causes turn overs
  * Offense scores frequently, defense stops scores
  
These directions are broad so that I explore each direction with multiple techniques to provided more insight.
